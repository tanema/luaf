Hello! I can't believe that you're here! I have never done a blog before but I
keep learning things here that I think I would like to practice writing about.

This project was never about implementing a version of lua that everyone would
use. It is more about my own learning. The best way to make sure that you actually
learned something is to explain it to someone else. So welcome my own rubber ducky.
