// Package luaf is an implementation of lua 5.4 for learning purposes and luafs ðŸ¤ .
// It aims to be fully feature compatible with lua 5.4 as well as additions to the
// standard library to make it more of an everyday use language instead of just
// as an embedded language.
//
//	`luaf` is still very WIP and really shouldn't be used by anyone except me and
//	maybe people who are interested in lua implementations.
//
//	`luaf` should be fully compatible with the lua APIs that are default in lua,
//	however it will not provide the same API as the C API. It will also be able to
//	precompile and run precompiled code however that precompiled code is not compatible
//	with `lua`. `luac` will not be able to run code from `luaf` and vise versa.
//	Since the point of this implementation is more for using lua than it's use in Go
//	there is less of an emphasis on a go API though a simple API exists.
