luaf is an attempt at an implementation of lua 5.4 mostly for my own learning
purposes and luafs ðŸ¤ 

![](./docs/luaf.svg | width=100)

## Getting Started
- `make check` ensure you have the tools installed for the project
- `make install` install luaf
- `make test` run tests
- `make help` for more commands to develop with

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `luaf` should be fully compatible with the lua APIs that are default in lua,
> however it will not provide the same API as the C API. It will also be able to
> precompile and run precompiled code however that precompiled code is not compatible
> with `lua`. `luac` will not be able to run code from `luaf` and vise versa.
> Since the point of this implementation is more for using lua than it's use in Go
> there is less of an emphasis on a go API though a simple API exists.

## TODOs
- [ ] `__call` is not called correctly with self defined.
- [ ] function calls are still messy, leftover stack data can end up in params
- [ ] `__gc` is not called on table items
- [ ] should use binary encoding for string.dump
- [ ] yield
- [ ] debug
  - [ ] debug
  - [ ] traceback

## Ideas for built in functionality
- http handlers
- database interactions
- WASM
- JIT [go assembler](https://github.com/twitchyliquid64/golang-asm)

## Documentation
Some notes that I have written myself in efforts to keep track of ideas

- [Parsing](./doc/parser.md)
- [Runtime, Bytecode & Virtual Machine](./doc/virtualmachine.md)
- [Lua Metamethods](./doc/metamethods.md)
- [Upvalues](./doc/upvalues.md)
