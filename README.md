# luaf
luaf is an attempt at an implementation of lua 5.4 mostly for my own learning
purposes and luafs ðŸ¤ 

## Getting Started
- `make check` ensure you have the tools installed for the project
- `make install` install luaf
- `make test` run tests
- `make help` for more commands to develop with

## Compatibility
`luaf` should be fully compatible with the lua APIs that are default in lua,
however it will not provide the same API as the C API. It will also be able to
precompile and run precompiled code however that precompiled code is not compatible
with `lua`. `luac` will not be able to run code from `luaf` and visa versa.

Since the point of this implementation is more for using lua than it's use in Go
there is no userdata behaviour implemented.

## TODOs Optimizations
- [ ] boolean shortcircuit. Right now only short circuits per binary and it could
    be patched to jump the rest of the boolean condition
- [ ] const folding. if we can precompute constants like 1+1 then we dont need an op
  - [ ] type hinting will help deeping const folding
- [ ] LOADI LOADF ect. Opcodes that allow faster minimal operations
- [ ] EXARG we can use loadi & setlist better
- [ ] Upvalue optimizations. Since upvalues need to be closed if we can minimize upvalues then we can speed things up.
  - [ ] const upvalues should just be locals since they don't get mutated.
  - [ ] unmutated upvalues can also be treated like locals.
- [ ] Bytecode param checking so that we do not overflow uints
- [ ] Peephole optimization on bytecode

Refer to what [roblox](https://luau.org/performance) did because they did some
brilliant stuff.

## Ideas for built in functionality
- Magic comments at the start of a file to enable optional functionality like ruby
    - disable auto string coersion to numbers
    - env readonly
    - disable new globals, only locals.
    - enable type checking levels
- Doc comments
- [Roblox Typesafe lua](https://luau.org/)
- [lua server pages](https://github.com/clark15b/luasp)
- templating
- database interactions
- http handlers
- json library
- WASM
